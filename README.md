## Dashboard Kit

Hello there! 
This is a project built in React for an internship application process, that must be concluded in 48 hours.
The main idea was to build three pages:
1. Login page
2. Overview page
3. Tickets page
All the data used was from a JSON or an example inside the code, not from a backend structure.

### Technologies
The main technologies used were:

* ReactJS
* Styled Components
* NextJS
* JSON

But if you wish to look into all the projects dependencies, please go to packages.json file.

### How to run
To run this app, it is necessary to have node/npm installed.
Download the corresponding version to your operational system and install it, from the link below:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once npm is installed, open the project in VSCode and install its dependencies, by running on the terminal:
```
.../dashboard-kit $ npm i
```
This command will install all dependencies listed in packages.json file.

Finally, run the service:
```
.../dashboard-kit $ npm run dev
```

Rush to your browser and type:
localhost:3000/

**There you are!** The project must be up and going.

### Link between pages
The first page is the login page. If you press "Login", it will redirect the page to the overview page (localhost:3000/overview).
Feel free to navigate the menu (although it is not completly implemented), but please don't forget to press "Tickets", since it is the third page implemented.
